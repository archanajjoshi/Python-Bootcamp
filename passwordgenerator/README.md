Notes for reviewer:
The course is a set of chapters and this chapter covered for loops only.
The earlier chapters talked about random module and lists
So apart from this, there is nothing too fancy in there as we have to stick to the material taught in chapters and try to solved the problem based on the knowledge acquired till the current chapter
